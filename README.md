## Topic Overview
In recent years, an innovation that has proven to be revolutionary in the world of digital assets has emerged: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This thesis focuses on the significance of NFTs at the intersection of three crucial domains: art, technology, and finance. This convergence has generated growing interest in the subject and raised questions about the future of ownership, authenticity, and value in this new digital era. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of this new world, this thesis commits to examining all aspects of non-fungible tokens through four distinct sections, beginning with the technology they employ and culminating in the practical application of the knowledge acquired.

## Structure
This thesis is divided into several sections for a comprehensive understanding of the topic:

- First Section defines NFTs and explains the related technologies they utilize, such as Blockchain and Ethereum, as well as the various algorithms (PoET, PoC, PoW, PoS), DAOs, Smart Contracts, and protocols they rely on.

- Second Section delves into the history of digital art, tracing an evolutionary path over time while highlighting early use cases of NFTs. The process of creating and selling NFTs is elucidated, including advantages and disadvantages in the artistic context.

- Third Section focuses on legal aspects, examining various issues related to copyright, ownership, and fraud from European and Italian perspectives, deepening with MiCA regulation.

- Final Section demonstrates the previously outlined concepts regarding non-fungible tokens through an example of a personal NFT creation on the OpenSea platform.

In conclusion, this thesis aims to provide a comprehensive framework for understanding NFTs, exploring their technological, artistic, legal, and practical implications, thereby contributing to a greater awareness and understanding of the potential of NFTs in the short and long term.

## First Section
### BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
Blockchain technology is a digital ledger, an immutable, transparent, distributed, and decentralized system that utilizes a chain of data blocks and nodes. A full node can also be a miner, in which case it requires significant computing power, such as an entire data centre with stacks of CPUs and a massive number of GPUs.

Each of these blocks consists of a set of data, which includes all recorded transactions transmitted to other nodes, resulting in extremely high data volume. A block has a header, indicating its creation timestamp, various versions or protocols used, a Merkle tree, a difficulty target, a nonce, and finally, a reference hash.

Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer network, an architectural approach where a centralized server is not required. Nodes do not have a hierarchical structure and can function as both clients and servers.

Blockchain employs asymmetric cryptography, ensuring that only the owner can decrypt a specific transaction using two keys, one private and one public.

### ETHEREUM
Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source platform launched in 2015 for creating applications and organizations, and conducting transactions, and it builds upon Bitcoin's innovation. However, it distinguishes itself by its programmability through a Turing-complete language in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Code on Ethereum consists of smart contracts stored in data structures.

### SMART CONTRACTS
Smart contracts are computer programs stored on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling the conversion of traditional contracts into digital ones. They consist of a collection of code with their own functions and values located at a specific Ethereum blockchain address. Their structure is logical: "If this, then that." Their behaviour is programmed and cannot be altered. Digital agreements are automatically executed when their terms are met. These smart contracts are implemented using a high-level programming language called Solidity.

## Second Section
The first NFT was "Quantum" in 2014, and the following year marked the beginning of the first blockchain-based game called "Spells of Genesis." In 2015, there were Rare Pepes, collectible cards that helped create the first crypto art market. You can see the emergence of generative art and a game developed on Ethereum in 2017 with CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties. In the subsequent years, we've witnessed the rise of Axie Infinity, Art Blocks, Decentraland, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club.

## Third Section
On April 20, 2023, the European Parliament voted on the 'Markets in Crypto Assets Act,' or MiCA, which was subsequently ratified by the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council on May 16, 2023. MiCA constitutes a unified regulatory framework within the European Union, encompassing all crypto-related activities, aiming to provide greater clarity in the evolving sector. Its goal is to ensure that the EU supports innovation and does not hinder the adoption of new technologies. This regulation will bring several benefits to EU countries by creating a balanced regulatory framework, providing consistency and ease in cross-border activities, and offering legal certainty for businesses operating within the European Union and for consumers.

## Final Section
The platform I have chosen to upload my NFT is OpenSea, and it is suitable for several reasons:

- OpenSea is the most popular and successful NFT platform with a wide range of users, offering greater visibility and exposure for NFT artworks.
- The platform supports various types of NFTs, including art, games, collectables, and virtual real estate.
- OpenSea's interface is highly intuitive and user-friendly, even for beginners.
- It supports various token standards and blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and others, providing flexibility in choice.

Among the various wallets available, I have chosen MetaMask for several reasons. It is easy to use, compatible with Ethereum and, consequently, with ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens. It is secure, compatible with dApps, and it has an active developer community constantly working to make improvements.

Lastly, as for the blockchain, I have opted for Polygon. One of the advantages of Polygon over Ethereum is its scalability. Polygon uses a second-layer solution that allows for processing a higher number of transactions at lower costs compared to Ethereum, making it more cost-effective for users like me who want to avoid high fees. Scalability also leads to faster transaction speeds compared to Ethereum, which can take several minutes to confirm a transaction, while Polygon can complete it almost instantly. Since Polygon is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it is compatible with smart contracts and tokens, allowing for easy transfer between blockchains.
